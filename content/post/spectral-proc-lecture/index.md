<!-- ### Predictive language model -->

Here is the video (and [slides](https://www.mcgill.ca/bic/files/bic/spec_decomp_nov2015_0.pdf)) for a lecture I gave at the MEG@McGill Comprehensive Training.

The code to produce some of the figures from the lecture can be found [here](https://github.com/pwdonh/spectral_analysis_lecture).

I teach a similar [lecture](../../files/comp_neuro_donhauser.pdf) in the Computational Neuroscience course (NEUR603) at McGill, which is accompanied by this Matlab [assignment](../../files/oscillations_assignment.zip).
