<!-- ### Predictive language model -->

The following app demonstrates outputs of the predictive language model described in our recent paper [Two distinct neural time scales for predictive speech processing.](../../publication/two-distinct-timescales)

The dot clouds represent the predictions of the model for upcoming phonemes (left panel) and words (right panel). Larger dots represent a stronger expectation. Click on the words to update the predictions of the model.
